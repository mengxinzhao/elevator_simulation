// Simulator class is the major component interfacing with control software/
//
// Simulator has a Ticker that synchronizes elevator events to its ticks. Simulation speed
// is controlled by ticker's interval setting. To the outside, a tick is a basic time unit.
// Elevator's speed is in relative term to the tick. Ticker is a singleton object in the
// simulation for the reason that if there is more object to simulate, the tick remains global.
//
// To receive control software input it uses async_io CommandGenerator to
// extract all valid commands and push them to a command streamer that feeds event dispatcher.
// Event dispatcher dispatches commands to a mock elevator and receives its feedback. This
// data path has no respect to the simulator ticks so to be close to reality as much as possible.
//
// Elevator is a simple state machine based. Its action synchronizes to
// the simulator tick. When a command is dispatched in the middle of tick interval,
// elevator's response is delayed at most by 1 tick.
